## Object Detection
---

> Finding Different objects in an Image and recognize them

#### Goals :
---

- Finding the list of bounding boxes \[(x, y)-coordinates\] for each known objects.
- Find all class labels associated with each bounding boxes.
- The probability/confidence score associated with each bounding box and class label.

#### Methods to find the Objects :
---

- Sliding Window.
- Image Pyramid.

#### Object Detection Frame Works
---

- R-CNN
- Fast R-CNN
- SSD (Single Shot Detectors)
- Faster R-CNN
- Mask R-CNN
- YOLO (You Only Learn Once)

#### Selective search for Object Recognition
